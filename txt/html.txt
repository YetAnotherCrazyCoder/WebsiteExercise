        <b>HTML5</b> is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different
        concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger
        set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set
        is sometimes called HTML5 &amp; friends and often shortened to just HTML5.
